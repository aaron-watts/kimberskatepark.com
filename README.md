# kimberskatepark.com

Kimber Skatepark webpage. Designed to be static, and self maintaining. Links to all socials, displays basic info and opening times, and collects upcoming events and holiday opening hours information from two public Google calendars.

- Uses OpenDyslexic3 font, to promote accessibility among SEND clients
- Designed with reduction of clutter in mind to assist in dyslexic reading - minimal use of distracting colour, larger line height and letter spacing, and only presents the information that is required
- All assets are hosted within the website, the only external services being the calendars
- Netlify hosted
- Netflify function used to make API call
- Uses Google Apps Script to fetch calendar events, falls back to iFrames if error occurs
- Highly accessible to Youth Workers as they only need to update a Google Calendar to make changes to the website, allowing ease of access and very low maintenance
